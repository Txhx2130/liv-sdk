Please review the terms and conditions in this License Agreement (“**License Agreement**”) carefully. 

Liv, Inc. (“**LIV**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, and/or “**our**”) has developed a suite of proprietary software to create relatable and shareable virtual reality experiences (“**Proprietary SDK(s)**”). LIV offers the Proprietary SDKs for free to developers who wish to test or embed them in software designed for gaming, educational, training, productivity, or multimedia/graphics purposes (“**Developer**” or “**you**”). LIV and Developer may be referred to herein collectively as the “**parties**” or individually as a “**party**”. 

Before proceeding, Developers must read and agree to this License Agreement and the license agreements of all open source or third-party components included in and distributed with the Proprietary SDK(s). Each Proprietary SDK (which includes all components, features, and functionalities, in object code form only, and all related documentation) is licensed separately. 

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY SOFTWARE CODE OR DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PROPRIETARY SDK(S), YOU ACCEPT (WHETHER ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR A LEGAL ENTITY YOU REPRESENT) THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT AS A BINDING CONTRACT AND CONFIRM THE FOLLOWING: (I) YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT; (II) YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU RESIDE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT WITH US; AND (III) YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT PERSONALLY AND, IF APPLICABLE, ON BEHALF OF ANY LEGAL ENTITY ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE ACTING AND TO BIND SUCH LEGAL ENTITY TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.  

If you are unwilling or unable to be bound by the terms in this License Agreement, do not download, install, access, or otherwise use the Proprietary SDKs. 

The terms of this License Agreement govern any Proprietary SDK(s) that include, display, or link to this License Agreement, and to any updates, supplements, or support services for the Proprietary SDK(s), unless such upgrade is accompanied by its own additional or different terms and conditions, in which case such additional or different terms or conditions shall be incorporated into this License Agreement and apply going forward. Your continued use of the Proprietary SDKs following such upgrade shall constitute your acceptance of such additional or different terms and their incorporation into this License Agreement.

Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, LIV hereby grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, non-transferable, revocable license during the term of this License Agreement to download, install, run, reproduce, and distribute the Proprietary SDK(s) in connection with the manufacture, sale, offering for sale, and distribution of interactive gaming, educational, training, productivity, or multimedia/graphics software developed by you (“**Your Software**”).
